## Configuring Language Pack

RTDF uses ConfigProvider to provide internationalized text, with the default configuration being Simplified Chinese. Configure it at the app entry, for example:

```tsx
import { ConfigProvider } from 'rtdf';
import { en_US } from 'rtdf/lang';

const App = () => (
  <ConfigProvider locale={en_US}>
    <Routes />
  </ConfigProvider>
);
```

All descendant components (including RTDF components) read the current locale. For scoped language, wrap a subtree with another ConfigProvider.

## Adding a Language Pack

If you cannot find the language pack you need, you are welcome to create a new language pack based on the [Chinese language pack](https://github.com/any-tdf/rtdf/blob/main/packages/rtdf/src/lib/lang/zh_CN.ts) or [English language pack](https://github.com/any-tdf/rtdf/blob/main/packages/rtdf/src/lib/lang/en_US.ts) and submit it as a Pull Request. [Language code table](http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm)

The basic steps are as follows:

- Please fork the [RTDF](https://github.com/any-tdf/rtdf) code to your own repository. If you have already forked it, please sync the latest code from the main repository.
- Clone your repository to your local machine.
- Add language packs in the `packages/rtdf/src/lib/lang` folder.
- (Optional) Update the documentation. Update the [internation.md](https://github.com/any-tdf/rtdf/edit/main/docs/mds/guide/internation.md) and [internation_en.md](https://github.com/any-tdf/rtdf/edit/main/docs/mds/guide/internation_en.md) files in the docs/mds/guide folder. Please update them in alphabetical order according to the lang list.
- Commit the modifications to your repository and then submit a Pull Request to the main repository.
- Once the Pull Request is approved during the review process, it will be merged into the main repository and a new version will be released on npm.
