# RTDF v2 to v3 Upgrade Guide

RTDF 3.0.0-alpha.0 is the alpha version of a breaking release. This version changes the package layout and public entry points: theme, locale, types, utilities, and UI component capabilities are exported from the `rtdf` package. Application code does not need to install or import `@any-tdf/common` directly.

## Core Changes

- The only public package to install is `rtdf`.
- Components are imported from `rtdf`.
- Theme APIs are imported from `rtdf/theme`.
- Locale APIs are imported from `rtdf/lang`.
- Types are imported from `rtdf/types`.
- Tailwind CSS only needs to scan `rtdf/dist`.
- Direct public usage of shared package paths is no longer supported.

## 1. Upgrade Dependency

```sh
bun add rtdf@3.0.0-alpha.0
```

If your `package.json` lists `@any-tdf/common` directly, remove it. `@any-tdf/common` may still be installed as an internal implementation dependency, but application projects should not depend on it explicitly.

## 2. Update Tailwind CSS Sources

Old syntax:

```css
@source "../node_modules/rtdf/dist";
@source "../node_modules/@any-tdf/common/dist";
```

v3 syntax:

```css
@source "../node_modules/rtdf/dist";
```

The RTDF 3.0.0-alpha.0 package output includes the class sources needed by components and shared capabilities, so there is no extra shared package directory to scan.

## 3. Update Theme Plugin Path

If your project still uses the shared theme plugin:

```css
@plugin "@any-tdf/common/theme" {
	name: "RTDF, Sage, GoldWood";
}
```

Change it to:

```css
@plugin "rtdf/theme" {
	name: "RTDF, Sage, GoldWood";
}
```

## 4. Update Code Imports

| Old Import | v3 Import |
| --- | --- |
| `@any-tdf/common/theme` | `rtdf/theme` |
| `@any-tdf/common/lang` | `rtdf/lang` |
| `@any-tdf/common/types` | `rtdf/types` |
| `@any-tdf/common/utils` | `rtdf/utils` |

Example:

```ts
import { switchMode, switchTheme, themes } from 'rtdf/theme';
import { zh_CN } from 'rtdf/lang';
import type { ThemeOptions } from 'rtdf/theme';
```

Components still come from the main entry:

```tsx
import { Button, Toast } from 'rtdf';

const App = () => <Button>Submit</Button>;
```

## 5. Unsupported Compatibility Paths

The following user-side patterns are no longer compatibility targets:

- Importing theme, locale, types, or utilities directly from `@any-tdf/common/*`.
- Scanning `../node_modules/@any-tdf/common/dist` in application CSS.
- Using `@plugin "@any-tdf/common/theme"` in application CSS.
- Depending on internal shared package folders such as `derived`, `svg`, or other implementation paths.

If you previously depended on shared package internals, migrate to the components, theme APIs, locale APIs, types, and utilities exposed by `rtdf`.

## Migration Checklist

- [ ] Upgrade `rtdf` to `3.0.0-alpha.0`.
- [ ] Remove direct `@any-tdf/common` declarations from project dependencies.
- [ ] Remove `@source "../node_modules/@any-tdf/common/dist";` from CSS.
- [ ] Change the theme plugin to `@plugin "rtdf/theme"`.
- [ ] Replace `@any-tdf/common/*` imports with `rtdf/*` imports.
- [ ] Run the project and verify themes, dark mode, locale behavior, and common components.
